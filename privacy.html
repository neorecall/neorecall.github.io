		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		
		<p>Last updated January 5, 2023</p>


	<br>


			

			<p>This Privacy Policy explains how NeuralJoy collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you access or use our website, mobile application, and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services"), and when you contact our customer service team, engage with us on social media, or otherwise interact with us. This policy does not apply to subscription eligibility information we receive from and process on behalf of our enterprise business customers and partners (defined as "Customer Data" in the applicable agreement), but this Privacy Policy does apply to your use of the Services, regardless of your subscription or account type. 
				Additional information for individuals in the EEA, UK, and Switzerland, as well as for California residents, can be found at the end of this Privacy Policy.
				We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our website homepage or sending you a notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services or otherwise interact with us to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you.</p>


			<br>


			<h1>Collection of Information</h1>


			<h3>Information You Provide to Us</h3>

			<p>We collect information when you register for an account, participate in interactive features (like by submitting a meditation rating or completing a check-in), fill out a form or a survey, participate in a contest or promotion, make a purchase, communicate with us via social media sites, request customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. The information you may provide includes your name, email, password, street address, payment method information, goals, previous meditation experience, moods and reflections you provide during check-ins, feedback and survey responses, and other information about you included within your messages to us or otherwise provided via the Services. Some users also provide health-related information in connection with providing feedback or other messages to us, and we process that information consistent with the purpose for which it was provided.</p>
			

			<br>


			<h3>Other Information About Your Use of the Services</h3>

			<p>When you use our Services, we collect the following information about you:</p>
			

			<p>• Usage Information: Whenever you use our Services, we collect usage information, such as the sessions you use, videos you view or content you listen to, what screens or features you access, and other similar types of usage information.</p>
			
			<p>• Transactional Information: When you make a purchase or return, we collect information about the transaction, such as product description, price, subscription or free trial expiration date, and time and date of the transaction.</p>

			<p>• Log Information: We collect standard log files when you use our Services, which include the type of web browser you use, app version, access times and dates, pages viewed, your IP address, and the page you visited before navigating to our websites.</p>

			<p>• Device Information: We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, device identifiers set by your device operating system, and mobile network information (like your connection type, carrier and region).</p>

			<p>• Information we Record: On some occasions, we may record phone or video calls with your consent, such as in connection with our coaching program or when you provide us with feedback or market research.</p>

			<p>• Information we Generate: We generate some information about you based on other information we have collected. For example, like most platforms, we use your IP address to derive the approximate location of your device. We also use your first name to make an educated guess about your gender and use information about your activity to help determine the likelihood of you continuing to use our Services in the future (which we hope will be the case!).</p>

			<p>• Information Collected by Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies: We use different technologies to collect information, including cookies and web beacons. </p>

			<br>


			<h3>Information We Collect from Other Sources</h3>

			<p>We also obtain information about you from other sources, including transaction information from third-party app stores you use to install our app or purchase a subscription, and name and contact information from third-party calendar services. Additionally, if you create or log into your account through a social media service account, we will have access to certain information from that account, such as your name and other account information, in accordance with the authorization procedures set by that social media service. Finally, we may obtain information about you from publicly available sources, marketing and advertising partners, consumer research platforms, and/or business contact databases.</p>
